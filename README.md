# A restaurant review site

Welcome to APP-A-TITE.  This app was developed in collaboration with classmates during my career at General Assembly.  We created this in order for the public to be able to read and review their favorite/least favorite restaraunts.  Reviews posted on a particular restaraunt will feature 3rd party reviews from sites such as yelp and google reviews.  It allows the users to form a better opinion of a restaraunt. 

  * Users will have an option to create an account as a reviewer or business owner
  * Users have the ability to read and leave reviews on restaraunts
  * Users can set their favorite restaraunts
  * Users can friend other users and see their favorites
  
# Technologies

This app will utilize the full functionality of CRUD.  The back-end server will be built in express/node with postgres handling the database queries.  The front-end UI will be rendered with REACT.  API calls to the database and external sites will be made using the axios module. Bootstrap will be the UI library used in styling the site.

# Instructions on testing in local environment

If you like to test server on your local machine, clone or fork this repo and run the schema.sql file located in the db folder. This will setup your local database. A few example users will be in there along with their data. Port can be setup to the users choosing.
